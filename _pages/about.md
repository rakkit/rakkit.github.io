Our underwater GYM is constructing now. It is proposed for better training Reinforcement Learning algorithm using simulation environment. This GYM is based on Unreal Engine and using Airsim for UE4/Python interaction, it will support any environment built up with UE4. In the near further, we will add multiples drones control for swarm !
